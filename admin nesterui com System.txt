Verify the Token:

Ensure the token you are using belongs to a user with sufficient permissions.

The user must have the required capabilities assigned in Moodle, such as webservice/rest:use and permissions for the specific function you are calling (core_webservice_get_site_info).

Enable the Web Service:

Go to Site Administration > Advanced features.

Ensure Enable web services is checked.

Check the Token’s Linked User:

Go to Site Administration > Server > Web Services > Manage tokens.

Confirm that the token is associated with the correct user and that the user has sufficient roles (e.g., Administrator).

Check Function Permissions:

Go to Site Administration > Server > Web Services > External services.

Ensure the core_webservice_get_site_info function is added to the web service that the token is linked to.

Create a New Token:

If the token is not working, create a new token with the appropriate permissions:

Go to Site Administration > Server > Web Services > Manage tokens.

Click Create token, select a user with Administrator permissions, and generate the token.

Verify IP Restrictions (if any):

If IP restrictions are enabled for web services, ensure that the server’s IP is added to the allowed IPs:

Go to Site Administration > Security > IP blocker.

Enable the REST Protocol:

Go to Site Administration > Server > Web Services > Manage protocols.

Ensure the REST protocol is enabled.

Test the API:

Once all configurations are verified, test the API again using the following simplified request:

python
Copy
Edit
